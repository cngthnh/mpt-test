        "Last year, I did a surfing instructor course, and I spent the summer teaching people to surf. It was great! I was in the sea and sun all day, and every evening, my friends and I had a barbecue on the beach. I don’t want to stay in the UK. It’s too cold here! I want to fly to Greece or Egypt. I’ll go there alone. I’m sure I will meet lots of cool people there!",
        "The Edinburgh Festival has happened in August every year since 1947, except for 2020. The idea for a festival came from Rudolf Bing, an Austrian who loved and sponsored the arts. Bing was the general manager of the famous Opera House at Glyndebourne in the South of England. He wanted to organise an international festival of music and opera to help fund the Opera House."
